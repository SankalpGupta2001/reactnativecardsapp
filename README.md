Set up to run the project : 

1) Open the Project in one folder and in one terminal
2) cd EmployeeCards
3) npm install -g expo-cli
4) npm install
5) npx expo start

6) As I was using expo so now the project will run in the terminal and now you can see it on Android, iOS, web anywhere.


Steps that I have done in the project : 

1) First I extracted the data from the link.
2) then I  follow steps 2, and 3 in instructions.
3) Now I have made the add employee form also to add the employee(Bonus and option point).
4) To add new employees I have passed the ID to them and will set paretId as null for no reporting manager (like for John Doe).
5) Now one click on the card will get subordinates of that employee.


Thank You so much
